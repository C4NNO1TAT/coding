    <h1>Allen basic html tag exercise</h1>
    <h2>Tags</h2>   

<p>
Are written in HTML often as pairs &lpar;an opening and a closing tag&rpar;.   
    </p>
        <h2>Void Tags</h2>  

<p>
    As these elements cannot contain other elements and are empty or void and only have a start tag since they can't have any content. Also considered as self-closing tags. For example the img tag to call up an image, or the br tag to create a forced line break.   
    </p>
    <h2>Heading tags</h2>   
<p>
There are six levels of heading. H1, H2, through to H6. As only one element can be the most important on a page it is good practice to only ever use H1 once per page. The content of the H1 is included as part of Google's page ranking algorithm; so importantly, should set the title and give a clear indication to the reader as to what type of information to expect to find in the document.
    </p>
    <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
<p>
Certain characters such as the angle bracket are reserved for HTML, so when using them in regular text to avoid parsing as html they a written with &amp; to start, a shortcode and finished with semicolom.
<br>    
Angle bracket less than &lt;
<br>
Angle bracket greater than &gt;
<br>
Ampersand &amp;

    <h2>Space in html</h2>
<p>
In html all excessive spaces are ignored and appear to collapse into one space. So to create space       around       use no-breaking space entity.
    </p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>There are three types of lists:</p>
<ul>

    <li>Ordered list &lpar;numbered points&rpar;</li>
